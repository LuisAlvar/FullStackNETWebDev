Absolutely! Ensuring the integrity of audit tables is critical for maintaining an accurate and tamper-resistant record of changes. Here are some additional security measures:

### **1. Restrict Direct Access**
- **Use Database Roles & Permissions**: Ensure only authorized users have permission to access or modify the audit tables.
- **Implement Row-Level Security**: Control access at the row level based on user permissions.

### **2. Use Database Encryption**
- **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**: Encrypts audit table data at the database level.
- **Column-Level Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive columns like `LoanAmount` to prevent unauthorized access.

### **3. Enable Schema Locking**
- **Disable Direct Modifications**: Restrict `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations on audit tables.
- **Use `DENY DELETE` Permissions**: Prevent accidental or intentional removal of audit records.

### **4. Implement Temporal Tables**
- **System-Versioned Temporal Tables**: Automatically track changes over time while preventing users from deleting historical data.

### **5. Utilize Digital Signatures & Hashing**
- **Generate Hashes for Rows**: Use `CHECKSUM` or `HASHBYTES` to create integrity checks for audit records.
- **Sign Data Entries**: Implement cryptographic signatures to ensure audit records are authentic.

### **6. Regular Integrity Checks & Alerts**
- **Database Auditing & Logs**: Enable SQL Server Audit to track changes at the system level.
- **Automated Integrity Verification**: Run scheduled integrity checks to detect unauthorized changes.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Notify administrators of any unauthorized modifications using SQL Server Alerts.

### **7. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) & Backup Strategies**
- **Enable Write-Ahead Logging**: Ensures every change is recorded before being committed.
- **Automate Backups**: Regularly back up audit tables to ensure recoverability in case of tampering.

With these measures, your audit tables will be well-protected against unauthorized access and data corruption. Let me know if youâ€™d like implementation details on any of these! ðŸš€
